title: Experiences with ESB
---

* SOA general
* ESB generations
  * layered architecture
    * To separate domain models
    * Cons: Too many dependencies, too big objects
  * single layer - focus on proxies
    * Less dependencies!
    * no mapping :)
    * transparent services
    * ... no need for a ESB product...
  * no mapping - invisible ESB
  * Similar to Gurilla SOA
* Suddently have 3 ESB generations to manage :(
