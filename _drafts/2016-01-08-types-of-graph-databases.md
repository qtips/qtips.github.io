title: Graph DBs - Types of Graph Databases (Part 5)
---

The three types of Graph databases
When doing my research on how graph databases work, I eventually discovered that there are several kinds of graph databases that differ significantly in their core. I was surprised because I thought that there could not be many optimal ways of creating a graph database, because I was comparing them to relational database theory which has been standarised for quite some time. This simply means that graph databases are still a little bleeding edge. In this post I will present the different types of graph databases and say a little about how they work.
