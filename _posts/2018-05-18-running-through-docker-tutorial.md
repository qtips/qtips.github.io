title: Learning Docker - From a single image to multinode swarm
enabledisqus: true

Docker offers a great tutorial to start learning Docker which drives you through creating your web app first image to deploying 
the web app to a multinode swarm. I followed their tutorial and took some notes, and did a little twist by using a local registry instead of Docker Hub. 

The notes are described on my github as readme files:

[Part 1](https://github.com/qtips/dockertutorial/tree/master/part1-friendlyhello): Creating your very first app with docker  
    
[Part 2](https://github.com/qtips/dockertutorial/tree/master/part2-friendlyhello-swarm): Deploying app on a single node local swarm using local registry 

[Part 3](https://github.com/qtips/dockertutorial/tree/master/part3-friendlyhello-swarm-multinode): Deploying app on a multinode swarm
