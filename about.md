I am a Software Engineer residing in Norway currently working as a consultant at [Bouvet](http://www.bouvet.no/en/).
I have worked mostly with backend and integration solutions, but my main interest is rather broad: I am driven by innovative ways of making solutions to problems.
In my [university](http://www.ntnu.edu/) years I was particularly interested in machine learning and wrote a [thesis](http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/papers/sea2010-CAMF.pdf) about using it on Android (1.6).
I still have an interest in machine learning, in particular automating complex tasks and processes using machine learning methods, and I hope to one day work within these fields.

I started blogging because I recalled how much I learned when writing essays or long papers back when I was in school, so my blog is actually just a way to learn
 new stuff, and to share it with others. Your comments and opinions are appreciated.
